                "1. **Lens System Calculation:**\n   - **Given:**\n     - Focal length, $$f = 400\\,\\text{mm}$$.\n     - Object distance, $$d_o = 800\\,\\text{mm}$$.\n   - **Apply Thin Lens Equation:**\n     $$\\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{1}{800} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$$.\n   - **Solve for $$\\frac{1}{d_i}$$:**\n     $$\\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{400} - \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{2}{800} - \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{1}{800}$$.\n   - **Find $$d_i$$:**\n     $$d_i = 800\\,\\text{mm}$$.\n   - **Result:** The image distance is **800 mm**.\n2. **Holographic System Calculation:**\n   - **Given:**\n     - Object distance, $$z_o = 800\\,\\text{mm}$$.\n     - Holographic imaging equation: $$z_i = \\frac{h}{\\tan(\\theta)}$$.\n   - **Assuming:** The aperture height $$h$$ remains constant.\n   - **Calculate $$\\tan(\\theta)$$:**\n     $$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{h}{z_o}$$.\n   - **Substitute back into $$z_i$$:**\n     $$z_i = \\frac{h}{\\tan(\\theta)} = \\frac{h}{\\frac{h}{800}} = 800\\,\\text{mm}$$.\n   - **Result:** The image distance is **800 mm**.\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth the lens system and the holographic system yield an image distance of **800 mm** when the object is located **800 mm** away. This demonstrates that, under these conditions, both systems produce images at the same distance, albeit through different physical processes.\n**Additional Context / Clarification:**\nIn holography, the image reconstruction relies on the precise replication of the wavefronts recorded during hologram formation. The angular relationships in the holographic equation stem from the geometry of the recording and reconstruction setup. In contrast, lenses manipulate light paths through refraction, following the thin lens equation derived from geometric optics principles."
