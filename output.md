### Problem HH-INTERFERENCE-0020
**Interference Intensity Calculation**
**Question**: You may use your notes and a computer for this problem.

There are two point sources, $$\lambda=633nm$$, that interfere at the origin.

Point 1 is radiating 2 watts of light and is located at:

  - x1 = 40 cm
  - y1 = 60 cm
  - z1 = 0 cm

Point 2 is radiating 5 watts of light and is located at:

  - x2 = -30 cm
  - y2 = 0 cm
  - z2 = 70 cm

Using the Master Interference Equation, calculate the intensity of the interference pattern at the origin.

Keep in mind that the intensity of an isometrically diverging point source is given by $$\frac{\text{total power emitted}}{4\pi R^2}$$ at any distance $$R$$.

### Solution for Problem HH-INTERFERENCE-0020
**Answer**: 1.9084

**Steps:**

1. 1. For each point source, the intensity at a distance $$R$$ is given by $$I = \frac{P}{4\pi R^2}$$, where $$P$$ is the power emitted.
2. 2. Determine the distance from each source to the origin using the coordinates provided.
3. 3. Calculate the phase and Intensity of each source relative to the origin. 
4. 4. Use the phase difference and the two intensities in the Master Interference Equation.
