### Problem HH-CONFIGFOCUS-0003
**Focus Relationship in Plate Angle Configuration C**

*Insight*: Configuration C creates compressed vertical focus through orthogonal beam alignment.

**Question**: In a phase conjugate holographic system where the reference beam is normal to the plate and the object beam is at an angle (Configuration C from pg 135), how does the vertical focus distance compare to the horizontal focus distance?

### Solution for Problem HH-CONFIGFOCUS-0003
**Answer**: Vertical focus distance is shorter than horizontal focus distance.

**Steps:**

1. 1. Configuration C uses orthogonal beam alignment
2. 2. Creates reverse astigmatism pattern
3. 3. Vertical focus forms closer to plate than horizontal focus
