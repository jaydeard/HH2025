### Problem HH-ARTIFACTS-0001
**Artifacts in Holographic Reconstruction: Twin Image and Zero-Order Terms**

*Insight*: Artifacts such as twin images and zero-order terms arise from imperfections in holographic recording and reconstruction processes.

**Question**: In a holographic reconstruction, a clear primary image is observed, but there is also an unwanted twin image and a bright central zero-order term. Explain the origin of these artifacts and suggest one technique to reduce each artifact during the reconstruction process.

**Answer**: Twin Image: Off-axis holography  
Zero-Order Term: Spatial filtering using a Fourier aperture.

**Steps:**

1. **Step 1: Origin of Twin Image**
2.    The twin image arises from the fact that diffraction has positive and negative orders.
3. **Step 2: Mitigating Twin Image**
4.    A common solution is to use **off-axis holography**, where the reference beam is angled relative to the object beam.
5. **Step 3: Origin of Zero-Order Term**
6.    The zero-order term originates from the unmodulated light passing directly through the hologram. It creates a bright spot at the center of the reconstructed image.
7. **Step 4: Mitigating Zero-Order Term**
8. **Spatial filtering** can be applied using an aperture at the Fourier plane to block the zero-order term.
