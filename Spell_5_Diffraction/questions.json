        "description": "Calculate the locations of first, second, and third-order diffraction beams on a screen when a laser interacts with a diffraction grating.",
        "difficulty": "Intermediate",
        "insight": "The angles of diffracted beams can be calculated using the grating equation, and their positions on a screen can be determined using trigonometric relationships.",

        "question_text": "A HeNe laser beam (λ = 633 nm) travels along the z-axis and is incident on a grating of spatial frequency 742 cy/mm. Find the locations of the first, second, and third-order beams on a screen 1 m away when the grating is perpendicular to the z-axis.",
        "hint": "Use the grating equation: $$\\sin(\\theta_{out}) = m \\lambda f$$, where $$f$$ is the spatial frequency of the grating. Then calculate the position on the screen using $$x = z \\cdot \\tan(\\theta_{out})$$.",

                "Use the grating equation: $$\\sin(\\theta_{out}) = m \\lambda f$$.",
                "Substitute the given values: $$\\lambda = 633 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}$$, $$f = 742 \\text{ cycles/mm} = 742 \\times 10^3 \\text{ cycles/m}$$.",
                "Calculate $$f \\cdot \\lambda$$: $$= 742 \\times 10^3 \\cdot 633 \\times 10^{-9}$$.",
                "For each order (m=1, m=2, m=3), calculate $$\\theta_{out}$$ using $$\\arcsin(m \\lambda f)$$.",
                "Use $$x = z \\cdot \\tan(\\theta_{out})$$ to calculate the position on the screen (z=1 m).",
                "Evaluate for m=1: $$\\theta_{out} ≈ 28°$$, $$x = 1000 \\cdot \\tan(28°) ≈ 532 \\text{ mm}$$.",
                "Evaluate for m=2: $$\\theta_{out} ≈ 69.9°$$, $$x = 1000 \\cdot \\tan(69.9°) ≈ 2730 \\text{ mm}$$.",
                "Evaluate for m=3: $$\\theta_{out}$$ exceeds the critical angle, resulting in evanescent behavior.",
                "Conclusion: The first-order beam is at 532 mm, the second-order beam is at 2730 mm, and the third-order beam is evanescent."
