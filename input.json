    "question_text": "A holographic silver halide emulsion has extremely fine grains (35 nm) to resolve fine interference fringes. Explain how this fine grain size impacts holograms recorded in the film.",
    "hint": "Smaller grains improve resolution but reduce the light sensitivity of the emulsion.",

        "final_answer": "Smaller grain size reduces light sensitivity but improves resolution.",
        "steps": [
            "Sensitivity in holographic emulsions depends on the ability of grains to absorb light photons.",
            "Smaller grains have less surface area to absorb photons, reducing sensitivity.",
            "However, smaller grains enable better spatial resolution because they can record finer interference fringes.",
            "This creates a trade-off: smaller grains improve resolution but reduce sensitivity.",
            "Conclusion: Silver halide emulsions with 35 nm grains prioritize resolution over light sensitivity."
