    "final_answer": "1.9084",
    "steps": [
        "1. For each point source, the intensity at a distance $$R$$ is given by $$I = \\frac{P}{4\\pi R^2}$$, where $$P$$ is the power emitted.",
        "2. Determine the distance from each source to the origin using the coordinates provided.",
        "3. Calculate the phase and Intensity of each source relative to the origin. ",
        "4. Use the phase difference and the two intensities in the Master Interference Equation."
